System configuration
Consider the following sample sysconfig file which defines the characteristics of our hardware and the time-quantum for scheduling. Note that lines commencing with a '#' are comment lines, and the 'words' on each line may be separated by one-or-more space or tab characters. All speeds are in bytes-per-second (Bps), all times are in microseconds (usecs), and all I/O sizes are in bytes (B). We may assume that the format of the sysconfig file will always be correct, so we do not need to check for errors.
